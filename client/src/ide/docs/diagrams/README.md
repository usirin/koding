### Getting started with UML drawing

We are using PlantUML for drawing our IDE diagrams. [Here](http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/index.html) is the homepage of PlantUML.

To draw UMLs you have two options.

##### Generate and watch locally
- Download plantuml.jar from [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/plantuml/files/plantuml.jar/download)
- Install Graphviz using `brew install graphviz`
- Run plantuml.jar using `java -jar plantuml.jar`
- Change jar watching directory to `koding-repo/client/ide/docs/diagrams`
- Change file extension to `uml`
